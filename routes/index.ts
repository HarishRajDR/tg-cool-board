      "The Cool Wall, introduced in the sixth episode of Series 1, was a wall on which Top Gear presenters Jeremy Clarkson and Richard Hammond decided which cars were cool and which were not by placing photographs of them on to various sections of the wall. The categories were, from left to right; 'Seriously Uncool', 'Uncool', 'Cool', and 'Sub Zero'.",
